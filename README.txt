This Python program is a console-based Hangman game where players guess the name of a randomly selected animal.
The animal names are read from a file (animals.txt) and one is chosen at random. 
Players attempt to guess the name by suggesting one letter at a time, with a maximum of six incorrect guesses allowed.
The program uses visual ASCII art to display the progress of the game, including a representation of the "hangman" based on the number of mistakes.
Correct guesses reveal the letter's position, while incorrect guesses update the hangman graphic and reduce the player's remaining lives.
The game ends when the player successfully guesses the entire word or exhausts all allowed mistakes.
Features include tracking used letters, dynamic display of the current word state, and interactive feedback to encourage players.
